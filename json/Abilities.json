It is perfectly fine, if you wish, to write down the values of the Miracle dice in your pool, or to keep track of them in any other way, just so long as both players can see them.</i><br><br><span class=\"h_custom\">Performing an Act of Faith</span><br>Before making a dice roll for a model or a unit from your army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can perform an Act of Faith. To do so, select one or more of the dice from your Miracle dice pool, instead of making any or all of those dice rolls. For each individual dice that is being rolled as part of the dice roll, you can select 1 Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool to be substituted in place of that dice. The dice that it is being substituted for is not rolled, and instead the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled. Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll any remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:<br><ul><li><a href=\"/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Advance\">Advance roll</a></li><li><a href=\"/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit\">Charge roll</a></li><li><a href=\"/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll\">Hit roll</a></li><li><a href=\"/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll\">Wound roll</a></li><li><a href=\"/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#4.-Saving-Throw\">Saving throw</a></li><li>Damage roll</li><li><a href=\"/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Morale-Tests\">Morale test</a></li></ul>A Miracle dice is not a modifier or an inherently modified dice (so, for example, if you use a Miracle dice with a value of 1 for a Morale test, that is considered to be an unmodified roll of 1). A Miracle dice that has been used for a substitution can never be re-rolled. This means that if any <a href=\"/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Re-rolls\">re-rolls</a> occur, the number and values of any Miracle dice that have already been substituted in the dice roll remain the same for the re-roll (for example, if a single Miracle dice was used to substitute one of the values of a charge roll, and the charge roll was re-rolled, only the unsubstituted dice can be re-rolled).<br><br><i><b>Example 1:</b> Instead of rolling one D6 to see what value is added to a unit’s Move characteristic when that unit <a href=\"/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Advance\">Advances</a>, you could use a dice from your Miracle dice pool. If the value of that dice was 5, you would add 5\" to the Move characteristic of every model in that unit for that <a href=\"/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE\">Movement phase</a>.<br><br><b>Example 2:</b> Instead of rolling 2D6 to see what a unit’s <a href=\"/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit\">charge distance</a> is when making a charge roll, you could use either one or two dice from your Miracle dice pool. If you chose 2 Miracle dice, and the values of those dice were a 6 and a 3, the unit’s charge distance would be 9\".</i>"
