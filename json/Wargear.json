While many doubt the word of the Veiled Path in this, there can be no denying that Crescendo is a beautifully crafted and uniquely potent firearm. When the pistol’s trigger is pulled, micro-distortion engines engage within its housing. The effect is to step Crescendo’s wielder slightly ahead of time, allowing an impossible volley of firepower to be unleashed."

    "legend": "Towards the end of the Moirae Schism in M35, a radical sub-sect of the Moirae creed known as the Xarisians indulged in rampant techno-heresy in the attempt to win the civil war that split the Adeptus Mechanicus. Hunted down as hereteks even by the members of their own creed, the dark adepts of the Xarisians were slaughtered and their malefic technologies destroyed. However, one of their creations – the powerful laser destructor known as the Diamonas – survived the war, and it is said that many bitter battles have been fought amongst the Fallen households for its possession."
